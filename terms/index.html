  <h1>LeoCore — Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Last updated: 2025</p>

  <p>
    By using LeoCore, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree,
    please do not use this app. Simple and fair.
  </p>


  <h2>1. What LeoCore Is</h2>
  <p>
    LeoCore is a free AI chat tool designed for learning, research,
    productivity and general assistance. Replies are generated by AI models
    and may not always be perfect, complete, or accurate. Use LeoCore at your own discretion.
  </p>


  <h2>2. Fair Use</h2>
  <p>
    You agree to use LeoCore responsibly. That means no abuse, no attempts
    to harm the system, no illegal activity, and no content that violates laws.
  </p>


  <h2>3. No Professional or Medical Advice</h2>
  <p>
    LeoCore is not a doctor, lawyer, financial advisor, or licensed professional.
    LeoCore AI provides information for educational and research purposes only. Outputs are generated by an AI model (Llama 3.1) and may be inaccurate, incomplete, or biased. Users must verify all information independently. We are not responsible for any decisions made based on AI output.
  </p>


  <h2>4. Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    LeoCore may temporarily process chat data to generate responses.
    At this stage, LeoCore does not intentionally collect personally identifiable
    information unless you choose to provide it yourself.
  </p>
  <p>
    For full details, see our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>


  <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    LeoCore is provided “as-is” with no guarantees.
    We are not responsible for any losses, damages, or consequences
    that may result from using the app.
    In no event shall our total liability to you exceed £10 or the amount you paid us in the last month (whichever is lower).
  </p>


  <h2>6. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms may be updated occasionally to improve clarity
    or reflect new features. Continued use of LeoCore means you 
    accept the updated Terms.
  </p>

    If you need help or want to report something,
    you can contact the developer at:
